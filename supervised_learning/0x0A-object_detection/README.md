## 0x0A. Object Detection
### Description 
In this project we try to solve this questions:


- What is OpenCV and how do you use it?
- What is object detection?
- What is the Sliding Windows algorithm?
- What is a single-shot detector?
- What is the YOLO algorithm?
- What is IOU and how do you calculate it?
- What is non-max suppression?
- What are anchor boxes?
- What is mAP and how do you calculate it?
