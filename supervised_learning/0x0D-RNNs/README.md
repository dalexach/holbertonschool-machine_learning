### Files
#### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-rnn_cell.py](0-rnn_cell.py) | Class RNNCell that represents a cell of a simple RNN. |
| [1-rnn.py](1-rnn.py) | Function rnn that performs forward propagation for a simple RNN. |
| [2-gru_cell.py](2-gru_cell.py) | Class GRUCell that represents a gated recurrent unit. |
| [3-lstm_cell.py](3-lstm_cell.py) | Class LSTMCell that represents an LSTM unit. |
| [4-deep_rnn.py](4-deep_rnn.py) | Function deep_rnn that performs forward propagation for a deep RNN. |
| [5-bi_forward.py](5-bi_forward.py) | Class BidirectionalCell that represents a bidirectional cell of an RNN. |
| [6-bi_backward.py](6-bi_backward.py) | Update the class BidirectionalCell adding the public instance method backward that calculates the hidden state in the backward direction for one time step, based on 5-bi_forward.py. |
| [7-bi_output.py](7-bi_output.py) | Update the class BidirectionalCell adding the public instance method output that calculates all outputs for the RNN, based on 6-bi_backward.py. |
| [8-bi_rnn.py](8-bi_rnn.py) | Function bi_rnn that performs forward propagation for a bidirectional RNN. |
