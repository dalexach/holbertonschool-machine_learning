#### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-likelihood.py](0-likelihood.py) | Function likelihood that calculates the likelihood of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects. |
| [1-intersection.py](1-intersection.py) | Function intersection that calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with the various hypothetical probabilities, based on 0-likelihood.py. |
| [2-marginal.py](2-marginal.py) | Function marginalthat calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data, based on 1-likelihood.py. |
| [3-posterior.py](3-posterior.py) | Function posterior that calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data, based on 2-marginal. |
