### Files
#### Mandatory Tasks

| File | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [0-gp.py](0-gp.py) | Class GaussianProcess that represents a noiseless 1D Gaussian process, creating the class constructor and the public instance method kernel. |
| [1-gp.py](1-gp.py) | Updated the class GaussianProcess, adding the public instance method predict. |
| [2-gp.py](2-gp.py) | Update the class GaussianProcess,adding the public instance method update. |
| [3-bayes_opt.py](3-bayes_opt.py) | Class BayesianOptimization that performs Bayesian optimization on a noiseless 1D Gaussian process, creating the costructor of the class. |
| [4-bayes_opt.py](4-bayes_opt.py) | Update the class BayesianOptimization, adding the public instance method acquisition. |
| [5-bayes_opt.py](5-bayes_opt.py) | Update the class BayesianOptimization, adding the public instance method optimize. |
